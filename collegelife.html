<td align="center"> <font face="Forte" size="4" color="#7b605b"> I'll be sharing with you some of the lessons I learned in College! </br> </br>
1. Not everyone will like you but that's okay :-) </br>
<img src="c2.jpg" align="middle"> </br>
But as long as you have your true friends with you, it won't really matter. </br> </br>
2. Time management is the key!!</br>
<img src="c3.jpg" align="middle"> </br> 
Cramming and procrastination are your enemy. </br> 
College has taught me that my routine in highschool won't work now. </br>
Time management is truly helpful to avoid staying up late for </br>
projects, outputs that was given weeks ago. </br>
</br> 
3. You'll be able to do things, you didn't know you can do.

College is like a  box full of surprises! </br>
It kind of helped me to stay out of my comfort zone </br>
and enjoy the rest of my college life. 
</br> </br>
4. College requires <strong> A LOT OF PATIENCE </strong>.

Patience to review a lot of lessons, </br> 
multi-task different school works, </br>
and ofcourse extra patience for group activities :D 
5. And lastly, NEVER GIVE UP!
<img src="c6.jpg" align="middle"> </br>
It's okay to cry when frustrated or tired! But make sure </br>
after that you'll stand tall, chin up and face the reality </br>
again. Never give up because this journey is soooo worth it!
